This program creates smooth surfaces from Catmull-Clark subdivision surface modeling. The algorithm was devised by Edwin Catmull and Jim Clark in 1978 which is illuminated in wikipedia.

User guide
------------
Input sample file: **testfile**. First a few lines specify coordinates of vertices. Then line "f" indicates input of vertices ends and input of faces begins. Faces are repesented by its vertices. "0" means the first vertex which is "-1.0 -1.0 -1.0".

Controls
------------
- z,x: move camera
- l,k: subdived further or backwards
